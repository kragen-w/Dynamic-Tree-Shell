# Dynamic-Tree-Shell



    This program simulates a unix directory ui system within python, which also saves a madeup storage tree that can be reopened and saved.
    It includes two class objects, one for file objects and one for the entire file system. The user can do the functions ls, cd, touch, tree,
    mkdir, rm, rmdir, and pwd. If the user enters an unknown command or one of the commands is not as it should, the proper error messages is
    dislplayed. If quit is typed, the tree gets saved to a file. The fucntion reopens that file upon running again.
